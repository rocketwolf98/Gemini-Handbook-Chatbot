# ✨ Gemini_Handbook_Chatbot
----
This is a quick student handbook RAG chatbot made with Streamlit, Pinecone, Langchain, and Google Gemini API. In case you have an intention to adapt to your own use-case, please refer to the following requirements:

### ‼️ Requirements
- Google AI Studio API
- Pinecone API
- A good knowledge to how API keys work

### ⬇️ To Start 
You can start working (assuming you have your API Keys and environment variables set up on an *.env* file nad your *secrets.toml* file for Streamlit) by running this below: <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 🤷‍♂️ What Else?
This repository is still a barebones skeleton of the app. If you make you own, a Jupyter Notebook named *document_processing.ipynb* is a straightforward notebook that does the text processing and word embeddings. Please ensure you have your own PDF file ready, because it doesn't work by itself.

If you like to try this out, you can opt to open it here.
